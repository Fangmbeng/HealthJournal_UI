# 🧠 MedJournal AI — Intelligent Health Management Interface

MedJournal AI is an advanced, AI-powered front-end platform designed to revolutionize digital health tracking, personal genomics, and smart patient communication. Built with bleeding-edge tools like Next.js 15, Framer Motion, and Mermaid.js, this project stands as a testament to innovation at the intersection of software engineering, artificial intelligence, and personalized healthcare.

> 🏆 **Context:** This project exemplifies extraordinary achievement in UI/UX innovation and intelligent healthcare system design. It contributes novel, impactful features that bridge complex data architecture and user-centered AI interaction — worthy of global recognition.

## ✨ Features

- **🧬 Intelligent Architecture Designer**  
  Dynamically generates software architecture diagrams with Mermaid.js, tailored for healthcare systems — visual, interpretable, and export-ready.

- **📈 DNA-Driven Medication Profiling**  
  Integrates DNA methylation insights (via external APIs) to personalize medication tracking and optimize treatment plans.

- **🤖 Smart Conversational Interface**  
  Built-in chatbot workflows with pre-trained LLM endpoints for medication reminders, patient feedback, and cognitive behavior monitoring.

- **🩺 Patient Review + Risk Insights Engine**  
  Collects patient-generated feedback and renders AI-scored risk evaluations, visualized via animated parallax transitions and interactive charts.

- **📊 Modular Design + SDLC Integration**  
  Each UI card maps to a corresponding backend component in a modular, CI/CD-ready SDLC pipeline. Encourages scalable deployment across medical practices.

- **🌌 Interactive UI Experience**  
  Featuring animated 3D Spline scenes, dynamic particle systems, and subtle motion transitions that elevate user experience while preserving accessibility.
